# obsource
This is a Python script designed to obscure or deobscure Python source code files. It utilizes a simple byte-shifting algorithm based on a user-provided seed value for the transformation process. The script can be operated either through command-line arguments or interactive prompts, providing flexibility in usage. It includes basic functionalities like input validation, error handling, and logging, enhancing its reliability and user-friendliness. Note: This script employs 'Security through Obscurity', which should not be considered a robust security measure. It's primarily meant for hiding code from plain sight rather than providing any strong encryption or protection. "obsource_obscure.py" is just an example output. The seed for this example is "1234".
